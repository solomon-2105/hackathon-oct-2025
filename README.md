##  Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the `backend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd backend
        ```
    * Create and activate a Python virtual environment:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        # On Windows:
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        # On macOS/Linux:
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    * Install required Python packages:
        ```bash
        pip install Flask flask-cors pandas google-generativeai google-api-python-client python-dotenv
        ```
    * Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
        ```env
        GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
        YOUTUBE_API_KEY="YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
        ```
        *(**Important:** Replace placeholders with your actual keys. Ensure billing is enabled and APIs are activated in your Google Cloud Project for Gemini and YouTube Data API v3.)*

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Open a **new terminal**.
    * Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend 
        # (or cd path/to/your/project/frontend if you closed the terminal)
        ```
    * Install Node.js dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

You need to run both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    * In your first terminal (inside the `backend` directory with the virtual environment activated):
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
    * The server will start, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Server:**
    * In your second terminal (inside the `frontend` directory):
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```
    * This will compile the React app and open it in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:5173`.

3.  **Access the App:** Open the frontend URL (`http://localhost:5173` or similar) in your web browser.
